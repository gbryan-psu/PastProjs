We were never able to connect to w204 to properly test the program. Gabien tried connecting through ubuntu, macOS, and windows on a desktop. Yonathan tried to connect through windows as well as through ubuntu. Gabien went to see if he could physically access the lab on campus, but the lab was completely closed off to students. We wanted to reach out to TAs about this problem, but we never were able to meet with them about this issue because of long queue waits. When we did meet with TAs this was not an issue at the time as we were mainly worried about design and implementation of the actual program. We were not as worried about testing on w204 until a few days before project submission because we still did not have a completely working implementation. Once we did fix FCFS and tried connecting to the machines is when we faced a lot of problems with connecting, file downloading, and vpn set-up. We did use the terminal in Ubuntu, but we are not sure if these outputs will coincide with ones on a machine in w204.
